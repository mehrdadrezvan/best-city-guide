- an @impostorfella project -
.
Hey there guys,
.
This mini-project is actually a training job done as a homework (as I'm a newbie to all this and in the process of learning)
and I'd be more than glad if anyone would check it out and kindly leave a comment or drop a suggestion if you have any.
.
This is all done in elementary-level HTML and CSS and is based on the original work of @ukirderohit (the link to the original website (in English) can be found bellow).
I tried to have something a "bit" different by doing it all in Persian (Farsi) language.
.
Feel free to contact me if you have any problems understanding what I did.
.
Regards,
Mehrdad
