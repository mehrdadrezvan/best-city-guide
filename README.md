*simple css layout - training project*

#### Hey there guys,

This mini-project is actually a training job done as a homework (as I'm new to all this and in the process of learning)   
and I'd be more than glad if anyone would check it out and kindly leave a comment or drop a suggestion if you have any.

This is all done in elementary-level HTML and CSS and is based on the original work of @ukirderohit.   
I tried to have something a "bit" different by doing it all in Persian (Farsi) language.

Feel free to contact me if you have any problems understanding what I did.

Regards,   
**Mehrdad**

*(an **@impostorfella** project)*
